You've undoubtedly heard that eating processed food is unhealthy a lot. Preservatives and processed foods should be avoided, but nobody really truly explains why you should do so or why doing so is bad. So that you fully get why you should avoid these offenders, let's break it down.
Although it's true that we humans have a real propensity to become addicted to particular meals, this isn't entirely our fault. Almost all of the unhealthy foods we occasionally indulge in cause the dopamine neurotransmitter in our brains to be active. The brain feels fantastic after doing this, but only briefly. This also increases the likelihood of addiction, which is why some people constantly find themselves returning for more candy bars while not actually needing them. You can avoid all this by removing that stimulus altogether.
The high fructose corn syrup and other sugars that are abundant in processed and animal-based foods have almost little nutritional value. Many studies are now confirming what many people already knew: eating foods that have been genetically engineered causes intestinal inflammation, which makes it more difficult for the body to absorb vital nutrients. The downside of your body failing to properly absorb essential nutrients, from muscle loss and brain fog to fat gain, cannot be stressed enough.
Your body perceives artificial compounds as foreign substances when you consume them. They essentially turn into an intrusion. Your body isn’t used to recognizing things like sucralose or these artificial sweeteners. So, your body does what it does best. It triggers an immune response which lowers your resistance making you vulnerable to diseases. The focus and energy spent by your body in protecting your immune system could otherwise be diverted elsewhere.
In their quest to load up on more animal protein most people end up displacing the plant protein that they already had. This is bad because unlike plant protein, animal protein often lacks in fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients. Fiber deficiency is quite common across different communities and societies in the world. In the USA, for instance, according to the Institute of Medicine, the average adult consumes just about 15 grams of fiber per day against the recommended 38 grams. Lack of adequate dietary fiber intake is associated with an increased risk of colon and breast cancers, as well as Crohn’s disease, heart disease, and constipation.
